Whenever we hear the word fashion instantly amazing celebrities, designers and popstars comes into mind. We all wants to dress like them. But then we hit the ground reality that they have expert designers and people, to help them look like they look. But I feel it’s not like that, now we are in a new high-tech instantly changing world where everything is accessible on finger tips. Before diving deep into the fashion as it is, come on let us see why we must consider fashion as an integral part and talk about it.

WE ALL DRESS THE MESSAGE. The clothes we wear and the way we groom our-self will change the way other people hear what you say. It will subconsciously tell them if we’re like them or if we’re different. It will determine whether they listen or ignore. Trust or distrust.

1. Clothing is the primary instrument in creating a positive first impression

2. Clothing can increase your perceived status among your peers

3. Dressing sharp helps with your confidence

4. The requirements of dressing sharp teach responsibility

5. A good dresser notices detail in others

6. Dressing sharp makes you more useful at work

7. Colors and patterns speak for you

8. Specific clothing pieces make statements about you

9. Good looking men call the shots

Alright guys so now we are all pumped up and have understanding why we should dress well so why not read about how the fashion industry and fast fashion works and understand is it really good for us and the nature or not.

“FAST FASHION” is a buzz phrase in the sustainability world. And as we continue to encourage the industry to move towards a more sustainable and ethical future, it’s helpful to know what we’re up against. But what does this term *really* mean?

Fast fashion is a design, manufacturing, and marketing method focused on rapidly producing high volumes of clothing. Garment production utilizes trend replication and low-quality materials in order to bring inexpensive styles to the public. These cheaply made, trendy pieces have resulted in an industry-wide movement towards overwhelming amounts of consumption. Unfortunately, this results in harmful impacts on the environment, garment workers, and, ultimately, consumers’ wallets.

Fast fashion might sound good in short term but over the long period it will only harm us and the environment. It has caused many problems people have become undecisive impulsive and you can’t even imagine how much time we spend on deciding what to wear. Let’s talk about this in detail and what should we do!!

HOW MUCH TIME WE WASTE ON DECIDING WHAT TO WEAR?

According to The Telegraph, a recent study found that the average woman, in the course of her lifetime, spends almost one year standing in front of her closet deciding what to wear. The study — which polled 2,491 women and was based on an adult lifetime from age 16 to 60 — found that women spend an average of 16 minutes deciding what to wear on weekday mornings and 14 minutes on Saturdays and Sundays, for a whopping 287 days spread out over their lives.

Hitting the town on Friday night? That’ll cost you another 20 minutes. Christmas party or fancy dinner event? Tack on another 36 minutes. Heading out of town for a vacation? The study claims 52 minutes (although those women must not have read my rules for packing like a pro!) And on regular weekday mornings, most women try on at least two outfits before deciding what to wear to work.

I BET WE ALL HAVE SAID “I HAVE NO CLOTHES” LET’S SEE WHAT IT ACTUALLY MEANS!!

“No clothes” usually means I have an exact outfit in my mind and yet I don’t own the pieces to put that outfit together…you know, sometimes the need for a pair of lemon yellow short shorts strikes and when you find yourself without ’em, it’s utterly devastating. But “nothing to wear” is a far, far worse fate. “Nothing to wear” involves emptying the entire contents of your closet onto your body and subsequently, your bed/desk/lounge chair and not seeing a single viable outfit option materialize. “Nothing to wear” really, really sucks, and I would have guessed that over the course of my 27 years on this planet, I’ve spent a solid three weeks in the purgatory that is “nothing to wear.” It is basically the result of indecisiveness.

Now what should we do to control this indecisiveness. How can we break these preoccupied notions that more clothes or expensive clothes is necessary to look delightful.

ORGANIZE OUR WARDROBE

Most people spend too much time in their closets looking for a favourite shirt or something to wear for work or school. That’s because closets are often the most common areas of disorganization, filled with items that are not used or even wanted. Yet, there they hang for all to see. According to recent studies, most people wear only 20% of the clothes in their closet. Consumers need to remember that very important percentage when they assess storage areas and closet space.

Some clothes are even buried so deep even archaeologists couldn’t find them. Is it time to get it organized?

**Consider these five important reasons for getting closets and storage areas organized:**

***Organization saves time: **There should be easy and quick access for all items and clothing. Everything must be visible and within reach.*

***Clothes management saves money: **When everything is visible and accessible, it is more easily inventoried for use. Less clothes usually means less money spent by the consumer.*

***The storage areas and closets need less space: **well organized clothes use less space in your closet.*

SHOP WITH A PLAN

Whenever shopping online or offline please do keep in mind what you already own and will this go with that you already own. Always plan out your shopping sessions before hand.

SKIP THE TRENDS

Instead of following trends, be loyal to the styles and colours that look best on you. After all, copying what’s on the runways isn’t for everyone. French style icons like actress Catherine Deneuve, known for her black cocktail dresses and trench coats, forge their own signature styles and stick to them.

ERROR AND TRIAL METHOD

If you feel this style will look good on you and you can carry it the go for it and wear it with confidence. Do experiment with different color combinations and outfits.
