## **What is Fashion?**
>  Fashion is about something that comes from within you — Ralph Lauren

Fashion is a style of clothing or a way of dressing that is popular at a particular time. Moreover, it is a feeling that what you are wearing is the best or we can say just gaining confidence out of your outfit that truly defines who you really are! Every second person in our society doesn’t know what is fashion but they wear fashion every day in their unique way! Fashion is basically all about you!

Does fashion only mean walking on the runway or dressing too much? oh yes, we don’t want to dress like Ranveer Singh for everyday fashion. But yes, we can dress in a way which makes us feel alive, comfortable and describes who we exactly are! And why can’t we convert our daily streets of office and college into our runway? Thus, fashion is a statement, not a style. Fashion fits all sizes and people of all ages. According to me, it is not an excuse to be pretty, popular, and charismatic but it is an art of self-expression.

## **How important is dressing well every day?**
>  Life isn't perfect but your outfit can be.

Dressing well every day answers the question of how you want your day to start? According to many studies, it is proved a man who dresses well is 80 percent more confident and imparts positive vibes than an untidy-dressed man.

As living in the society, we are always pushed by the mantra “it matters how you perform, not how you look.” And yes, in a perfect world that would be great; but we don’t live in a perfect world. How you are perceived by others before you say anything depends mostly on the signals you send with your physical appearance. People do judge you on your clothes before they judge your performance. Which makes the outfit an important part of our life. Dressing well every day requires a lot of effort and dedication but provides you many advantages! So, dressing well has many benefits!

**It is a form of self-care**

We all have good and bad days when we just want to lay on our beds but have you ever tried dressing too well on a bad day? doesn’t it helps? Suddenly, you start feeling yourself again as you get surrounded by some awesome positive vibes! Hence, dressing well is taking care of yourself by making an effort for yourself, it motivates you that you matter and this life matters the most be it on a good day or a bad day!

**It helps to build consistency**

Let’s face the facts. You have to put something on in the morning. I don’t know a single person that can leave their house naked — so not getting dressed isn’t an option. Since getting dressed is something that you’ll likely have to do every day for the rest of your life — why not do it well? Dressing well every day eventually becomes your habit, you start doing it every day, every morning not because you have to but you want to! The daily feedback of action-and-reward (outfit planning + feeling good about how you look) can help to make dressing well a habit that sticks on forever with you!

**It gives you a feeling of accomplishment**

People always say that if you win the morning, you win the day. What better way to win the morning than to have a stylish and well-coordinated outfit all laid out for you? Leaving the house in a great outfit gives an immediate feeling of accomplishment.

## **The need to organize your wardrobe.**
>  Where there is order, there is tranquility.

Did you know that according to a study almost 50 percent of people don’t wear every single piece of clothing they own? Or did you know that disorganized closets negatively affect our lives? no right, indeed, every time we open the doors of our closet, the clutter and messiness bring us a lot of stress, disturbs our focus and concentration.

According to the survey conducted by the One Poll 1 in 4 women admitted to having a disorganized closet which is affecting them mentally. Who would have thought that a closet can disturb our peace?

Have you ever wondered how much time do we waste finding clothes that we know are there in the closet but where? are they on the right, bottom shelves? and after so much struggle of finding that pair of clothes we often get tired and eventually think of something new then start finding that one! So, it is a vicious cycle that goes on and on until you find that lucky pair of clothing. Do you find it relatable to yourself? I guess, yes for sure!

The solution to all of this is simply an organized wardrobe, if you have an organized closet, you could save 30 minutes in a day that means saving 10,950 minutes every year. All it takes an incentive to fix the problem and you are good to go, no more wastage of time and no more stress! Once your wardrobes are organized and simplified, they become effective and economical too. We all love to see clothes hanging in the closet perfectly, am I right?

## **The importance of buying what you really need**
>  If you buy things you don’t need , soon you will have to sell things you need.

We all have heard of impulsive shopping. Yes, where we just buy everything without thinking once that do we really need this now or are we just buying because we are having a bad day or getting this at the cheaper deal. Sometimes we do shop more and more in an attempt to remove stress and anxiety. But what are we getting by doing all this? Nothing, just spending too much money and hanging unnecessary clothes in our wardrobe.

It is said that the key to happiness is to focus on what we need not what we want so if we apply this mantra to our daily shopping, we could save a lot of money and space in our wardrobes. Why don’t we try to mix-matching clothes that we already own or normalize repeating clothes! It is okay if you repeat clothes, you don’t need to spend a lot of time and money just because you are going out for a party. All you need is to try and remember the dress you brought some fine day and never worn. Shop in sales, who doesn't love to save money but if we organize our way of shopping, we can save both time and money which could also save us from buying repetitive clothes.

When it all comes down to shopping, buying only what you need which is not buying in excessive amounts with a touch of fashion will help us be smart and wise shoppers.
